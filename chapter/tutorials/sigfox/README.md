# Sigfox Tutorials

To ensure your device has been provisioned with **Device ID** and **PAC number**,
please update to the latest firmware.

The following tutorials demonstrate how to register and get started with Sigfox
enabled Pycom module. These modules can be configured for operation in various
countries based upon specified RCZ zones (see the ``Sigfox`` class for more info).
All our modules support both uplink and downlink Sigfox messages. The SiPy also
supports device to device communication via its FSK Mode.
