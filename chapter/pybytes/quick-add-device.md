# Quick add device

From firmware 1.16.x onward all Pycom devices come with build in *Pybytes library* in firmware
specifically in `/frozen` folder. This allows you to add your device quickly to Pybytes.
You can still upload your Pybytes library [manually](quick-add-device.md).

## Follow these steps 
Install [Firmware updater](https://pycom.io/downloads/) and follow these instructions.

Now firmware updater is updating your firmware. It is asking Pybytes for your device credentials 
like WiFi password. It will write these information to device's config block.

Now your device will reboot and will be connected to Pybytes.
