# Registering a Pycom Device

Some of our devices require registration before you can utilise specific features such as certain types of networking. Please see the list below for setup guides to ensure that your device is registered and activated on the various platforms required to access all of the available features.

- SiPy/LoPy4/FiPy - ([Sigfox Activation](../tutorials/sigfox/register.md))
- GPy/Fipy - To use the cellular features of these modules you require a nano
sim capable of LTE CAT-M1 or NB-IoT. You can find a map of deployed networks
and open labs, [here.](https://www.gsma.com/iot/deployment-map/#deployments)


{% hint style='info' %}
**Not all Pycom devices require activation**; most features work immediately out of the box!
